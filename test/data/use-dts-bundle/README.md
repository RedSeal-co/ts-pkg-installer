Package whose interface is generated by dts-bundle (simulated).

The bundle-dts.sh script in this directory was used to generate index.d.ts.  It can be recreated as follows:

```
rm -rf node_modules typings
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/tsd reinstall
./bundle-dts.sh
```

The TSPI configuration is typical for a module that uses dts-bundle, in that it specifies the name of the generated
declaration file as `mainDeclaration`, and it turns `noWrap` on, since dts-bundle already wraps the declarations in an
ambient module declaration.
